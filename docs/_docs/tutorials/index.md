 - [Decorators Tutorial](decorators/) Run a grid of tests for a gridtest or custom decorator.

## Real World Examples

 - [pySchrodinger](https://github.com/researchapps/pySchrodinger): a walk through of creating a grid to run over a Schrodinger class to generate metrics and results for inspection.
 - [clustering-grids](https://github.com/vsoch/gridtest/tree/master/examples/clustering-grids): an example of taking a scikit-learn tutorial of algorithms and datasets, and splitting into grids to collect metrics for each.
