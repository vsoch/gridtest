gridtest.func are short functions that serve as helpers for a gridtest.
Any function in here can be referenced as {% func_name %} or with arguments
{% func_name arg1=1 arg2=2 %}. If you possibly have a namespace
conflict, you can also reference {% gridtest.func.func_name %} and
it will work to reference the function here.
