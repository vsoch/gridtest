GridTest isn't just for testing! In fact, you can write a file of grid
specifications that can be loaded and used for parameterization, or your own
custom functions. The description here will follow example the files in the
[grids](https://github.com/vsoch/gridtest/tree/master/examples/grids) examples folder.
Here is a peek at the top of this file, where we define two grids:

```yaml
mygrids:
  grids:

    # A grid that will generate 10 empty set of arguments
    generate_empty:
      count: 10

    # A grid that will generate each cross of x and y (total of 9)
    generate_matrix:
      args:
        x: [1, 2, 3] 
        y: [1, 2, 3] 
```

## Loading via a GridRunner

Let's say that we have a grids.yml file with grids defined. We can load with
gridtest easily via the GridRunner:

```python
from gridtest.main.test import GridRunner
runner = GridRunner('grids.yml')
# [gridtest|grids.yml]
```

We can easily generate the grids as follows:

```python
runner.get_grids()
{'generate_empty': [grid|generate_empty],
 'generate_matrix': [grid|generate_matrix],
 'generate_lists_matrix': [grid|generate_lists_matrix],
 'generate_by_min_max': [grid|generate_by_min_max],
 'generate_by_min_max_twovars': [grid|generate_by_min_max_twovars]}
```

## Loading as a Grid

A Grid is a first class citizen, so you can also generate without
the GridRunner, either via a json object or yaml you've loaded:

```python
from gridtest.main.grids import Grid

grid = Grid(name="mygrid", params={"args": {"one": [1, 11, 111], "two": 2}})
[grid|mygrid]
```

### Cached Loading

By default, grids are generated on demand, meaning that the argument sets (optionally
derived by functions you have provided under params) are generated at this point in time.
For example:

```
for argset in grid:
    print(argset)

{'one': 1, 'two': 2}
{'one': 11, 'two': 2}
{'one': 111, 'two': 2}
```

This also means that, by default, your grid.argsets will be empty when you
instantiate it.

```python
grid = Grid(name="mygrid", params={"args": {"one": [1, 11, 111], "two": 2}})
grid.argsets
[]
```

This is done intentionally because it can sometimes take a lot of memory to store
a long list of argument sets. However, if you want to generate the argument sets
on init, just set "cache" to True in your params:

```python
grid = Grid(name="mygrid", params={"cache": True, "args": {"one": [1, 11, 111], "two": 2}})
```

You should then be able to see the argsets ready for your use!

```python
grid.argsets
[{'one': 1, 'two': 2}, {'one': 11, 'two': 2}, {'one': 111, 'two': 2}]
```

### Grid Functions

What if you want to generate a long list of items for an argument, and it would
be crazy to type them out? This is what the functions specification for a grid
is for. You would provide your functions, each associated with an argument, under
the "functions" section. As an example, let's say we want to run random.choice,
and select from a list defined under the argument "choices":

```python
import random
grid = Grid(name="mygrid", params={"functions": {"pid": random.choice}, "args": {"seq": [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]]}})
```

The above would look like this in yaml:

```yaml
grids:
  mygrid:
    args:
      seq: [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]]
    functions:
      pid: random.choice
```

And we would generate our argument sets:

```python
list(grid)
[{'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 2}]
```

This also points out another important point - if you were to provide a list for an
argument, it would be parameterized. If you want the entire list treated as one variable,
then define it within another list as shown above. The above grid says "generate the argument
pid by using random.choice to select from seq." How does the grid know to match seq to random.choice?
It's a known keyword argument! Another insight here is that although we define a sequence argument, we don't actually
need it, we really only care about the result (pid). But let's say we want to generate
10 x a pid, how do we do that? We add a count to the params:

```python
grid = Grid(name="mygrid", params={"count": 10, "functions": {"pid": random.choice}, "args": {"seq": [[1,2,3,4,5,6,7]]}})
list(grid)

[{'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 5},
 {'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 1},
 {'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 3},
 {'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 7},
 {'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 5},
 {'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 7},
 {'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 1},
 {'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 4},
 {'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 1},
 {'seq': [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7], 'pid': 3}]
```

These values are being generated by an iterator and not saved to any single list in memory,
so although it seems very rundant to see the same list more than once, it shouldn't
serve significant issues with respect to memory.


## Viewing on the Command Line

You can also preview the grids generated from the command line. First you might
want to list all grids defined in a file:

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids.yml
generate_empty
generate_matrix
generate_lists_matrix
generate_by_min_max
generate_by_min_max_twovars
```

and then inspect a specific named grid:

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids.yml generate_empty
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
```

If you want to export your entire grid to json, possibly to read in as-is
later and use, add --export:

```bash
$  gridtest gridview grids.yml generate_by_min_max --export exported.json 
```
```bash
cat exported.json
[
    {
        "x": 0.0
    },
    {
        "x": 2.0
    },
    {
        "x": 4.0
    },
    {
        "x": 6.0
    },
    {
        "x": 8.0
    }
]
```

That's not a really interesting grid, but you get the gist.
Each of the grids listed above will be explained below in more detail.

## Writing Grids

Let's start with the most basic of grids, which are those that don't import any
special functions. 

### Header

The header should have a named section for the grids that you want to define
(e.g. `mygrids`) and then a `grids` index, under which we will write each
of our named grids. Here is the start:

```
mygrids:
  grids:
  ...
```

Then each grid is added as a named section below that:

```
mygrids:
  grids:

    # A grid that will generate 10 empty set of arguments
    generate_empty:
      count: 10
```

The full content of this file will be written to the [grids.yml](grids.yml)
example here. Each example grid is discussed below. For each example,
you can preview the grid in the terminal with `gridtest gridview` or
obtain the grid by instantiating the `GridRunner` as shown above.

### Empty

It could be that you need to generate empty lists of arguments for a function,
in which case the `count` variable will be useful to you. Here is
how to specify a grid that will generate 10 empty set of arguments

```yaml
generate_empty:
  count: 10
```

The result comes out to be:

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids.yml generate_empty
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
{}
```

### Parameterize Variables

Let's say that we have two variables, x and y, and we want to generate a grid
of all possible combinations for a listing of each. That would look like this:

```yaml
    generate_matrix:
      args:
        x: [1, 2, 3] 
        y: [1, 2, 3]
```

And the resulting grid will have 3x3 or 9 total combinations of x and y:

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids.yml generate_matrix
{'x': 1, 'y': 1}
{'x': 1, 'y': 2}
{'x': 1, 'y': 3}
{'x': 2, 'y': 1}
{'x': 2, 'y': 2}
{'x': 2, 'y': 3}
{'x': 3, 'y': 1}
{'x': 3, 'y': 2}
{'x': 3, 'y': 3}
```

### Parameterize Lists

If you want to do similar but instead have a list of values be paramaterized, just 
specify a list of lists instead.

```yaml
    generate_lists_matrix:
      args:
        x: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] 
        y: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]] 
```

The result will have 2x2 or 4 entries:

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids.yml generate_lists_matrix
{'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [1, 2, 3]}
{'x': [1, 2, 3], 'y': [4, 5, 6]}
{'x': [4, 5, 6], 'y': [1, 2, 3]}
{'x': [4, 5, 6], 'y': [4, 5, 6]}
```

Here is an easier way to check the count:

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids.yml generate_lists_matrix --count
4 argument sets produced.
```

### Range of Values

For most use cases, you'll want to generate a list of values over a range. You
can do that with **min** and **max** and (optionally) **by** that defaults to 1.

```yaml
    generate_by_min_max:
      args:
        x:
          min: 0
          max: 10
          by: 2
```

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids.yml generate_by_min_max
{'x': 0.0}
{'x': 2.0}
{'x': 4.0}
{'x': 6.0}
{'x': 8.0
```

Here is an example with two variables:

```yaml
    generate_by_min_max_twovars:
      args:
        x:
          min: 0
          max: 10
          by: 2
        y:
          min: 10
          max: 20
          by: 2
```

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids.yml generate_by_min_max_twovars 
{'x': 0.0, 'y': 10.0}
{'x': 0.0, 'y': 12.0}
{'x': 0.0, 'y': 14.0}
{'x': 0.0, 'y': 16.0}
{'x': 0.0, 'y': 18.0}
{'x': 2.0, 'y': 10.0}
{'x': 2.0, 'y': 12.0}
{'x': 2.0, 'y': 14.0}
{'x': 2.0, 'y': 16.0}
{'x': 2.0, 'y': 18.0}
{'x': 4.0, 'y': 10.0}
{'x': 4.0, 'y': 12.0}
{'x': 4.0, 'y': 14.0}
{'x': 4.0, 'y': 16.0}
{'x': 4.0, 'y': 18.0}
{'x': 6.0, 'y': 10.0}
{'x': 6.0, 'y': 12.0}
{'x': 6.0, 'y': 14.0}
{'x': 6.0, 'y': 16.0}
{'x': 6.0, 'y': 18.0}
{'x': 8.0, 'y': 10.0}
{'x': 8.0, 'y': 12.0}
{'x': 8.0, 'y': 14.0}
{'x': 8.0, 'y': 16.0}
{'x': 8.0, 'y': 18.0}
```

Logically there are the previous number of tests, but squared.

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids.yml generate_by_min_max_twovars --count
25 argument sets produced.
```

## Grids with Functions

## What does it mean to use a function?

You can map functions to parametrs in a grid, meaning that the values for
the parameters will be generated by the function. For example,
let's use the function `random.choice` to dynamically generic a grid of parameters.
The grid below will call `random.choice` ten times (count is set to 10) 
across the sequence of values `[1, 2, 3]`, which is an input key word argument
to random choice.

```yaml
...
  grids:
    random_choice:
      count: 10
      functions: 
        pid: random.choice
      args:
         seq: [[1, 2, 3]]
```

Notice that the sequence argument input is a list of lists, and this is because we want the entire list to be treated as an argument. If we run this from it's respective file, we get a result with 10
argument sets:

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids-with-function.yml random_choice
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 2}
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 2}
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 2}
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 1}
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 3}
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 1}
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 3}
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 3}
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 2}
{'seq': [1, 2, 3], 'pid': 3}
```


## Grids with Custom Functions

If you are using a script for any of your grids that isn't a system installed
module, then (akin to a standard gridtest) it needs to be included under a section 
header that is named by the relevant module, and that includes the filename to import.
For example, the file [script.py](script.py) in the present working directory has
a function, `get_pokemon_id` that I want to use. Here is how I'd write the recipe:

script:
  filename: script.py 
  grids:

    # A grid that will generate 10 random values using a custom function
    generate_pids:
      functions: 
        pid: script.get_pokemon_id
      count: 10
```

Now let's run it!

```bash
$ gridtest gridview grids-with-function.yml generate_pids
{'pid': '125'}
{'pid': '780'}
{'pid': '508'}
{'pid': '566'}
{'pid': '803'}
{'pid': '513'}
{'pid': '854'}
{'pid': '405'}
{'pid': '639'}
{'pid': '353'}
```

Akin to the previous example, since we've provided a function to pass our grid
arguments into, the results are returned. This is how gridtest can
use a grid specified under a test to generate a list of values for an argument.

## What to do with Grids?

You might just be using grids inline to go with your [tests](../testing/). However,
grids are useful to many things:

 - create input spaces to test different machine learning models
 - keep parameterizations under version control
 - create a parameter space to export to json to use for a non-Python use case
 - and of course testing to create a parameter space

Next you might want to read about how gridtest grids can be 
[used in tests](https://vsoch.github.io/gridtest/getting-started/metrics/#adding-arguments).
